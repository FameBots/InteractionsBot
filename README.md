# HttpInteraction Bot
Our first try to work with the HTTP Interaction from Discord!



# LET ME TEST THIS???
Sure use our public bot for that: 
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=927598798019108894&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands 




## SelfHost
> Our repository contains code that isn't intended to be hosted. These files are here to help you understand how the bot works, and not how to install it on your own server.
